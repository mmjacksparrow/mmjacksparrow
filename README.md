## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 1. RAG-Based Document Intelligence System
**Tech:** Python, LangChain, LLMs, Vector DB, Streamlit  

**Description:**  
An AI-powered system that allows users to upload documents (BRDs, PDFs) and query them using natural language. Responses are generated using Retrieval-Augmented Generation with source references.

**Key Highlights:**
- Document chunking & embeddings
- Semantic search with vector DB
- LLM response grounding
- Accuracy & hallucination test cases

📌 *Demonstrates GenAI + testing mindset*

---

### 🔹 2. Python ETL Data Validation Framework
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, PyTest  

**Description:**  
A reusable framework to validate ETL pipelines by comparing source and target data.

**Validations Included:**
- Row count checks
- Null & duplicate validation
- Data type consistency
- Mismatch reporting (Excel output)

📌 *Strong real-world ETL & QA relevance*

---

### 🔹 3. LLM Response Testing Framework
**Tech:** Python, PyTest, OpenAI / LLM APIs  

**Description:**  
A testing framework designed to validate LLM outputs for:
- Accuracy
- Relevance
- Consistency
- Edge cases & prompt drift

📌 *Bridges QA expertise with AI systems*

---

### 🔹 4. AI-Powered ETL Log Analyzer
**Tech:** Python, LLMs  

**Description:**  
An AI assistant that analyzes ETL job logs, identifies failure causes, and suggests fixes.

📌 *Realistic production-use AI tool*

---

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

I strongly believe:
> **AI systems must be tested like software — with data accuracy, edge cases, and reliability in mind.**

My projects emphasize:
- Data validation
- Reproducible results
- Clear test strategies
- Real-world failure scenarios
